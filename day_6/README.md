Objective Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops.

Task Given a string,s, of length n that is indexed from 0 to n-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example

Print abc def
